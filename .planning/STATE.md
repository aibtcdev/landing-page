## Decisions Log

- **2026-02-12**: Quest created for issues #107 (heartbeat separation) and #102 (persistent llms.txt instructions). 3 phases: library+API, discovery docs, UX+verification. Previous quest (open issues sprint + x402 inbox verification) archived.
- **2026-02-12**: Design decision #6 added — graceful deprecation with breadcrumbs. `/api/paid-attention` will return 410 Gone with migration instructions when it detects `type: "check-in"`, pointing agents to `/api/heartbeat` and `llms.txt`. No dead ends.
- **2026-02-12**: Phase 1 completed. Created lib/heartbeat/ module, /api/heartbeat endpoint with orientation system, 410 Gone breadcrumb in paid-attention, and CLI route with middleware support. 4 commits on feat/heartbeat-api branch.
- **2026-02-12**: Phase 2 completed. Updated all 4 discovery docs (llms.txt, llms-full.txt, agent.json, openapi.json) to reference /api/heartbeat as post-registration orientation step. Added "save this as memory" instruction to llms.txt. Updated Paid Attention sections to remove check-in type (task responses only). Updated CLAUDE.md with Heartbeat System section. 5 commits on feat/heartbeat-api branch.
