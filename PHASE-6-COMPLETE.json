  "summary": "Research completed and implementation finished. The AIBTC Bitcoin wallet skill already exists in the aibtc-mcp-server repository with proper Agent Skills formatting. Landing page now references the skill through all discovery mechanisms (llms.txt, agent.json, README, CLAUDE.md). Documentation clarifies separation of concerns: MCP server owns executable tools and skill docs, landing page owns platform APIs and discovery docs. No repository migration needed - architecture is correct.",
